# YCharts_Hashmaps
An implementation of a hashmap

The class HashMap is an implementation of HashMap.  HashMapTests is a suite of tests that put this class through its paces.  I have included tests to manage a hash clash. 

The tests can be run in an ide or at the command line using: 

    
**python3 -m unittest HashMapTests**

Make sure the following libraries are installed: 

* Mock
* Unittest
